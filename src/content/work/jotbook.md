### Authentication

Jotform Login Flow

Together with our mentor and team members, we have developed a minimum viable product plan that includes both essential features and additional functionalities aimed at improving the overall user experience. I contributed to this effort by developing a responsive and user-friendly design with a clear and consistent layout and navigation structure. I achieved this by creating reusable React components and utilizing existing components from the Jotform library.

To facilitate easy collaboration and maintain clean code, I established a feature-based folder structure. For our editor outline, I developed an algorithm that parses markdown content input to detect headings and renders it in an outline component simultaneously. Additionally, I implemented JotForm login functionality using components from the Jotform library and utilized Redux Toolkit to create slices for each feature for state management.

I collaborated with my teammate, brainstorming ideas and features, and we worked on the JotForm frontend monorepo using the pnpm package manager. I kept our fork up-to-date with the JotForm frontend repository and collaborated with my team mate using Git. I also learned how to write unit tests.

Developed a user guide, which included a playground bar designed and managed
the uı states to allow users unfamiliar with markdown syntax to try and view the
different outputs of React markdown elements, best practices and pitfalls of
markdown language.

Designed and developed a visually aesthetic landing page.
This required me to use my knowledge of web design and aesthetics to create an
eye-catching and engaging landing page that would attract and retain users.

My teammate and I had the exciting opportunity to present our project to all the
employees at JotForm. During the demo, we introduced the main features of the app,
including how to use it, change request flows, and edit features. The demo was a
chance for us to demonstrate the value we brought to the project and how our work
helped to improve the overall user experience.

To make searching for content easier, I developed a search modal and overlay with a fade-in CSS animation
for the search in documents. This feature required me to use my knowledge of CSS and React useRef hook
to create an engaging and user-friendly search experience in an efficient way


Customized the components of a React markdown editor library to meet the specific needs of Jotform's
document management tool. This allowed me to embed a variety of dynamic elements such as YouTube and
Loom iframes, gifs, images, and links, resulting in a more engaging and interactive user experience.


### Final

Overall, my experience at Jotform was an incredible opportunity to gain practical
experience in frontend development and refine my skills. The company's focus on
user experience inspired me to create engaging interfaces that enhance the
user experience, which is a skill that I will carry with me throughout my career.

Working alongside senior developers was also a significant learning opportunity.
I was always encouraged to ask questions and seek guidance, which helped me to
develop my skills further. Their guidance and support were instrumental in my growth
as a developer, and I am grateful for the time they spent mentoring me
