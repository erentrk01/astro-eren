During my tenure at Orion Innovation, I played a key role in [SmartDelta](https://smartdelta.org/) 
International R&D project, a part of [ITEA4](https://itea4.org/). The project's focus was on "Automated
Quality Assurance and Optimization in Incremental Industrial Software Systems
Development."

Effectively advanced the extraction of mappings between microservices based on
business requirements, starting at 60% completion and successfully achieving 100%.
•
This accomplishment significantly enhanced the accuracy of understanding and
optimizing system interactions, ultimately contributing to improved software quality
and operational efficiency.

Developed state-of-the-art UI/UX interfaces for troubleshooting use cases using an
innovative node-based interactive visualization approach, combining the [d3-force](https://d3js.org/d3-force)
layout and [reactflow](https://reactflow.dev/) library.

Refactored the frontend architecture to improve decoupling and separation of
concerns, resulting in a more maintainable and scalable codebase.

Collaborated closely with DevOps engineers and ML engineers to gather feedback
and enhance the user experience and functionality.

Integrated data science prediction module and Node.js backend by contributing to both Python
Flask and Node.js APIs.
