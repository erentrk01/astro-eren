#### Customer 
Netcad, founded in Ankara in 1989, is the first domestic company pioneering to the digitalization of spatial data. Having been developed by the common contribution of Turkish engineers, academicians, and the users, Netcad is located at the core of spatial data ecosystem.

[NETPROMine](https://en.netcad.com/en/products/netpromine) is a 3D mine design solution that offers integrated modeling tools for resource estimation, open pit, underground design, open pit optimization processes, and that is used to plan and manage mining operations seamlessly.

This [NETPROMine](https://en.netcad.com/en/products/netpromine) software have different kinds of 3d file outputs are needed to visualized in web applications 

We Developed [Netcad3d](https://netcad3d.netlify.app/), a web-based 3d scientific visualization application from scratch to  visualize [3d file outputs](https://docs.vtk.org/en/latest/design_documents/VTKFileFormats.html) in browser.

<br>The app enables verified users to upload and view vtk legacy data files.<br>Authorized users can also view .vti,.vtp, and.web3d files without having to upload them.
