Web-AR Smart Indoor Gardening System provides a seamless urban gardening experience through an easy-to-set-up, low-cost hardware kit. Featuring an IOT device with battery and sensors, this kit enables the device camera to become a portal to comprehensive statistics and visually engaging representations during plant scanning, thanks to Augmented Reality. The system adeptly monitors and predicts anomalies and schedules tasks based on environmental variables, such as soil moisture, light density, and air quality. Also, users can remotely receive updates on anomalies and the health status of their plants, ensuring informed and proactive care.
